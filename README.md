# Ron Gorai - BlackRock Coding Exercise, 5/11/23

This is my submission for a BlackRock coding exercise. I hope you are impressed! Thank you again for your consideration.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have the latest version of `node` installed.
```
$ node -v
v19.6.0
```

Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/rgorai/blackrock-coding-exercise-5-11-23.git
```

Navigate into the project root.
```
cd blackrock-coding-exercise-5-11-23
```

Install the required dependencies.
```
npm install
```

## Usage
First, start the proxy server.
```
npm run start-server
```

Then, in a new shell, execute the main script.
```
npm run main
```

## Extra Points
1. Implementation can be found in `src/questions.ts`.
2. Implementation can be found in `src/api.ts`.
3. I believe this was a good test of a candidate's skills, and enjoyed completing it. It exercises a handful of basic skills, as well as some more complicated ones with the extra points. Meanwhile, it still leaves room to expand and show some personality, which I believe I have done. If I were to make some improvements, I would include some more job-specific tasks, like creating a small React application or using more TypeScript features.
